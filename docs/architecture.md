# Architecture and contributor guide

NOMAD installs as one C#/.NET Framework 4.8 DLL inside Mission Planner. Its embedded
private x64 media executable runs capture and native vision outside the host process. The reviewed
host is pinned in [target metadata](https://github.com/McGill-Aerial-Design/NOMAD/blob/main/scripts/release/mission-planner-target.json).
Use its actual APIs and the existing owners below when extending the plugin.

Mission Planner owns the connection and MAVLink reader. ArduPilot executes flight
and native failsafes. The router's C# sources compile into the same DLL; the
optional firmware under `firmware/ardupilot/` builds separately and runs onboard.

## Find and reuse the owner

Paths below are under [mission_planner/src](https://github.com/McGill-Aerial-Design/NOMAD/tree/main/mission_planner/src)
unless shown otherwise.

| Area | Existing owner and responsibility |
|---|---|
| Plugin lifecycle | `Plugin/NOMADPlugin.cs` and partials: Init, Loaded, Loop, Exit, menus and shared owners |
| Aircraft configuration | `Config/NOMADProfiles.cs`, `NOMADConfig`, `NOMADStorage`: validated drafts, selected profile, atomic persistence and host data paths |
| Native dispatch | `Control/OutputController.cs` and `.Payload.cs`: connection identity, generations, write eligibility and native host helpers |
| Custom controls | `GimbalController`, `PayloadController`, `TerminationController`; `Input/` owns HID sampling and bindings |
| Fence setup | `Geofence/`: polygon validation, native editor drafts and `FenceParameters` read/write/readback |
| Telemetry and alerts | `Telemetry/BatteryHealth.cs`, `AltitudeUnits`, `Notifications/NotificationService` and `AudioAlerts` |
| Video | `Media/VideoSession` owns bounded analysis/display lanes; `MediaWorkerHost` owns the child; `SharedVideoCapture` shares each source; views own presentation |
| Vision | `Vision/IVideoDetector`, `IVisualTracker`, `VisualTrackerFactory`: model and tracker boundaries |
| Links | `Connectivity/MAVLinkConnectionManager` projects the router in `infra/transport/ground_router/` through `IRouterStatusProvider` |
| Views | `Views/`, `Panels/`, `UI/ControlFactory`, `NOMADTheme`, `NOMADViewBase`, `UiAsync`; `IUpdatableView` is declared in `Plugin/NOMADMainScreen.cs` |
| Simulation | `Simulation/` owns the optional page/session; `scripts/simulation/` supplies development launchers |

Read the owning symbol, callers and closest tests before changing behavior.
Partial files divide one owner; they are not separate services or new extension points.

## Read aircraft telemetry

For display-only state, follow `NOMADDashboardView.UpdateFlightCards`:

```csharp
var mav = MainV2.comPort?.MAV;
var cs = mav?.cs;
if (cs?.connected == true)
{
    // Display cs.mode, cs.armed, cs.gpsstatus, etc.
}
```

Read the selected aircraft each update. A cached `MAVState` can belong to a prior
aircraft, and `cs.connected` does not establish packet freshness. Reuse
`BatteryHealth.Read(mav, index)` for native battery thresholds. `CurrentState.alt`
and `sonarrange` follow MP display units; use `AltitudeUnits.ToMeters` with the
host multiplier. Check the owning field's units before doing calculations.

Commands and motion estimates need stronger evidence. Follow
[VideoMotionHistory](https://github.com/McGill-Aerial-Design/NOMAD/blob/main/mission_planner/src/Media/VideoMotionHistory.cs):

1. Capture the selected target through `OutputController.CaptureTarget(config)`.
2. Read its `Connection.MAV.getPacketLast((uint)messageId)` packet cache.
3. Verify system/component, UTC receipt time, age, finite values and valid ranges.
4. Recheck `target.IsCurrent` before admitting a result or dispatching work.

A cache read returns the last packet, including old data. Define a freshness bound
appropriate to the action; do not turn missing telemetry into a healthy default.
Existing packet subscriptions must be removed by the subscribing owner. Never add
another `BaseStream` reader or a parallel MAVLink connection to obtain telemetry.

## Send commands through Mission Planner

UI and HID call the existing Gimbal/Payload/Fence/Termination controllers.
`OutputController` binds work to the connection, stream, selected system/component
and profile generation. Disconnects, selection/profile changes and read-only or
playback contexts retire unsent work.

When extending a controller, use the captured target and explicit-target host APIs
such as `doCommandAsync`, `setMountControl` and `setParamAsync`, following the
adjacent implementation. Mission Planner owns ACK waits and retries. Preserve
input neutral/confirmation rules, finite/range checks and Safe/Stop behavior.
An already-dispatched helper may finish after Stop or unload; report submitted,
accepted, unknown and independently observed outcomes truthfully.

The optional router gives MP one loopback UDPCl connection and sends each command
through one selected physical route. It owns deduplication, failover and parameter
transaction pinning. Reuse that owner instead of adding a transport. Normal
arming, modes, missions, setup and landing remain in Mission Planner.

## Profiles, UI and lifetime

`NOMADProfiles` owns draft/copy/import/export and explicit Save activation.
Loading validates the current schema without rewriting files; saving atomically
replaces the collection with a backup. Use `NOMADStorage` for host-resolved paths.
Aircraft labels describe configuration and do not establish live aircraft identity.

Reuse `ControlFactory` and `NOMADTheme`. Views refreshed by the main screen implement
`IUpdatableView`. Use `UiAsync` to observe event-handler errors and marshal synchronous
updates to an existing UI handle. Unsubscribe events and dispose timers, frames,
capture leases and cancellation sources with their owner. Fence cached callbacks
by the plugin session; hiding a view does not retire a shared owner.

Video capture, ONNX/OpenCV/DirectML and model validation execute in one private media
child. It has no Mission Planner/MAVLink assembly reference or aircraft connection.
The parent keeps telemetry history, ground-hint policy and validated native commands.
Private current-user pipes carry bounded messages; fixed-capacity memory mappings
carry pixels. The parent copies into owned, bounded reusable pixel storage before UI
publication. Frame IDs/request epochs and parent source/model/selection revisions
fence late results. Selected frames and exports retain immutable pixel leases.

Capture, detection and tracking have independent lanes, each with latest-only pending
work. Blocking capture/display loops and the media-process exit wait use dedicated
workers, leaving the thread pool available for supervision and cancellation.
A four-frame/100 ms alignment window emits matching detection overlays or plain video;
late overlays never rewind displayed frames. Tracking consumes its own timestamped
samples and retains the 500 ms source-age limit independently of display cadence.
The selected outline uses the latest fresh verified tracking sample from the same
source and image size. Unverified, stale or retired selections clear the outline; exported
frame results remain matched to their source frame.
Each source has one native receiver across its camera, UDP or RTSP viewers.
Native custom output helpers execute off UI, outside the short controller state lock,
with one shared reservation held until actual native completion.

Stop invalidates presentation and steering immediately. `VideoSession.Completion`
observes asynchronous native cleanup; no UI caller joins a worker. The owned media
job is terminated after hung work/cleanup, and a failed shared worker retries once
into plain video. No target, model enable or tracking authority returns automatically.
A second failure requires explicit Start/Retry. Ordinary invalid models disable only
that feature. Already-admitted MP helpers may finish after retirement; no new neutral,
hold or termination command is invented. Native MP transport and OS/driver failures
remain outside the media fault boundary.

Default Object tracking uses CPU CSRT; explicit GPU Object tracking uses EfficientTAM
through DirectML. Area retains its fixed-point tracker. GPU runs sharing model sessions
are serialized in the child. Algorithms, calibrations and acceptance obligations remain
unchanged; process isolation does not qualify real-scene or physical tracking.

Fence staging modifies a native editor draft; native Write/Read transfers it.
Parameter changes separately require fresh disarmed state and readback. The optional
simulator starts only on request and owns its processes and private native handshake.
Plugin Exit retires inputs/callbacks and disposes shared resources. See
[safety](safety.md) and [development checks](development.md) before changing these contracts.
